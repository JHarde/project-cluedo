# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer

In this assignment I've created an online Cluedo game in which you pick three card that will give you a random killer, weapon and room where the murder was commited. I've used JavaScript to make all the functions work with a little help from HTML and CSS for styling. 

## The problem

Tech: JavaScript, HTML and CSS 
The initial problem was to get all the functions to work. The hardest part was probably to assign all the suspects a favourite weapon of choice and then shuffle the weapons so that they could be assigned new favourite weapons. I managed to do this with a certain function and managed to display the change through a button I named "change weapon". When clicking the button, the suspect will be assigned a new favourite weapon.
